# üìÑ Pagination

JSON REST Mock API supports powerful pagination features to efficiently manage large collections of resources.

**‚Üê [Sorting](./sorting.md) | [Table of Contents](./README.md) | [Next: Relationships ‚Üí](./relationships.md)**

## Pagination Methods

The API supports two pagination methods:

1. **Page-based pagination**: Traditional pagination using page numbers
2. **Cursor-based pagination**: Efficient pagination for large datasets using cursors

## Page-Based Pagination

Page-based pagination works by dividing the result set into pages of a fixed size.

### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `page` | Page number (starting from 1) | 1 | `?page=3` |
| `limit` | Number of items per page | 10 | `?limit=25` |

### Example Requests

```
GET /posts?page=2&limit=10
GET /users?role=admin&page=1&limit=20
```

### Response Headers

When using page-based pagination, the API includes the following response headers:

| Header | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `X-Total-Count` | Total number of matching resources | `X-Total-Count: 243` |
| `X-Total-Pages` | Total number of pages | `X-Total-Pages: 25` |
| `X-Page` | Current page number | `X-Page: 2` |
| `X-Limit` | Number of items per page | `X-Limit: 10` |

### Link Header

The response also includes a `Link` header with URLs for the first, previous, next, and last pages:

```
Link: <https://api.example.com/posts?page=1&limit=10>; rel="first",
      <https://api.example.com/posts?page=1&limit=10>; rel="prev",
      <https://api.example.com/posts?page=3&limit=10>; rel="next",
      <https://api.example.com/posts?page=25&limit=10>; rel="last"
```

## Cursor-Based Pagination

Cursor-based pagination is more efficient for large datasets as it uses a pointer (cursor) to the last item in the current page.

### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `after` | Cursor pointing to item after which to start | null | `?after=eyJpZCI6MTAwfQ==` |
| `before` | Cursor pointing to item before which to start | null | `?before=eyJpZCI6MjAwfQ==` |
| `limit` | Number of items per page | 10 | `?limit=25` |

### Example Requests

```
GET /posts?after=eyJpZCI6MTAwfQ==&limit=10
GET /users?before=eyJpZCI6MjAwfQ==&limit=20
```

### Response Headers

When using cursor-based pagination, the API includes these response headers:

| Header | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `X-Next-Cursor` | Cursor for the next page | `X-Next-Cursor: eyJpZCI6MTEwfQ==` |
| `X-Prev-Cursor` | Cursor for the previous page | `X-Prev-Cursor: eyJpZCI6OTB9` |
| `X-Limit` | Number of items per page | `X-Limit: 10` |
| `X-Has-More` | Whether more items exist | `X-Has-More: true` |

### Link Header

Similar to page-based pagination, a `Link` header with URLs for navigating the collection is included:

```
Link: <https://api.example.com/posts?limit=10>; rel="first",
      <https://api.example.com/posts?before=eyJpZCI6MTAwfQ==&limit=10>; rel="prev",
      <https://api.example.com/posts?after=eyJpZCI6MTEwfQ==&limit=10>; rel="next"
```

## Combining with Filtering and Sorting

Pagination can be combined with filtering and sorting:

```
GET /products?category=electronics&price_gt=100&sort=-rating&page=2&limit=20
```

This gets the second page of electronics products with price > 100, sorted by rating in descending order, with 20 items per page.

## Best Practices

- **Use cursor-based pagination** for large datasets or when efficiency is critical
- **Use page-based pagination** for smaller datasets or when you need to know the total number of resources
- **Set reasonable limits** to avoid performance issues (max limit is typically 100)
- **Include pagination parameters** in your API client to ensure consistent results
- **Process Link headers** to facilitate navigation between pages

## Implementation Details

The pagination mechanism works by:

1. Applying filters to the dataset
2. Sorting the filtered data
3. Applying pagination (either cursor or page-based)
4. Adding appropriate pagination headers to the response

## Examples

### Basic Page-Based Pagination

```
GET /users?page=2&limit=10
```

This retrieves the second page of users, with 10 users per page.

### Cursor-Based Pagination with Sorting

```
GET /posts?after=eyJpZCI6MTAwfQ==&limit=20&sort=-createdAt
```

This retrieves 20 posts after the one pointed to by the cursor, sorted by creation date in descending order.

### Complete Example

```
GET /products?
  category=electronics&
  price_gte=100&
  sort=-rating,price&
  page=2&
  limit=20
```

This retrieves the second page of electronics products with price ‚â• 100, sorted by rating (descending) and then by price (ascending), with 20 items per page.
