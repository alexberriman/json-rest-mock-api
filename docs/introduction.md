# üëã Introduction to Pretendo

**‚Üê [Table of Contents](./README.md) | [Next: Installation ‚Üí](./installation.md)**

## What is Pretendo?

Pretendo is a powerful development tool that allows you to create fully-featured REST APIs from a simple YAML or JSON specification. It's designed to accelerate frontend development by providing a realistic API backend without the need to build one from scratch.

## Why Use a Mock API?

When building frontend applications that consume REST APIs, you often face several challenges:

1. **Dependencies on backend teams**: Waiting for backend APIs to be ready before you can start frontend work
2. **Development velocity**: Needing to quickly prototype and iterate on UI before backend services are complete
3. **Offline development**: Working in environments where you may not have access to production services
4. **Edge case testing**: Testing error conditions and edge cases that are difficult to reproduce with real backends
5. **Integration testing**: Creating consistent test environments with predictable data

Pretendo addresses these challenges by providing a complete mock backend that behaves like a real REST API service, with minimal setup.

## Core Benefits

### üöÄ Rapid Development

Start frontend development immediately without waiting for backend APIs. Define your data model in minutes and get a working API.

### üìä Realistic Data

Generate realistic test data that matches your production schema. Configure relationships between resources to simulate real-world data structures.

### üõ†Ô∏è Complete Feature Set

Enjoy full CRUD operations, filtering, sorting, pagination, authentication, and more - all without writing a single line of backend code.

### üß™ Perfect for Testing

Create stable test environments with predictable data. Simulate network conditions, errors, and edge cases to thoroughly test your frontend.

### üíª Developer-Friendly

Simple configuration format, intuitive API design, and comprehensive documentation make it easy to get started.

## How It Works

1. **Define your schema**: Create a YAML or JSON file that describes your API resources, fields, and relationships
2. **Start the server**: Run a single command to start your mock API server
3. **Consume the API**: Use the auto-generated REST endpoints in your frontend application

## Use Cases

### Frontend Development

- Start building UI components with real API interactions immediately
- Develop offline or in environments with limited connectivity
- Test UI behaviors with various API responses and edge cases

### Testing

- Create consistent test environments with known data
- Simulate errors, latency, and other network conditions
- Run automated tests without external dependencies

### Prototyping and Demos

- Quickly prototype new features with a working backend
- Create impressive demos with realistic data flows
- Explore API design options before committing to implementation

### Learning and Training

- Learn REST API concepts in a hands-on environment
- Train new team members without affecting production systems
- Experiment with different API design patterns
